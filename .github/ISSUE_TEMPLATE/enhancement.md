<!--
Please adapt sections as needed while keeping core descriptions clear and detailed. These sections are guidance, but accurate information will help ensure effective handling of the issue or request.
-->

### Context:

<!--
Provide the background and context for the enhancement request.

Consider:
- What part of the system are you looking to improve, and why?
- Is this enhancement focused on performance, usability, developer experience, or another aspect of the tool?
- Are you aiming to extend, refine, or refactor existing functionality?
- Is this enhancement based on feedback from users, team discussions, or personal experience using the Ignite CLI?
- Has the current functionality been problematic, confusing, or insufficient in some way?
-->

### Proposed Enhancement:

<!--
Provide a clear and concise description of the improvement or update.

Consider:
- How does this enhancement improve or optimize existing functionality?
- Will this update require changes to existing commands, configuration files, or dependencies?
- How will this benefit developers using Ignite CLI (e.g., better performance, improved usability, easier configuration)?
-->

#### Alternatives Considered:

<!--
List any alternative solutions or approaches you've considered and why they may not be suitable.

Consider:
- Could this be addressed through a different enhancement or workaround?
- Would refactoring current code or extending existing functionality be better than introducing new features?
- Are there risks or trade-offs involved with the proposed solution (e.g., complexity, maintenance burden)?
-->

### Desired Outcome:

<!--
Describe what success looks like after the enhancement is implemented.

Consider:
- What specific improvement should be evident? (e.g., reduced build times, better error handling, cleaner code)
- How will this change be measured or evaluated (e.g., performance benchmarks, usability feedback)?
-->

### Notes:

<!--
Add any other relevant information or context that could help in implementing the enhancement request.

Consider:
- Are there specific examples or use cases that illustrate why this enhancement is important?
- Can you provide any relevant diagrams, mockups, or code snippets?
- Have you encountered any issues or challenges when using the existing feature that this enhancement would resolve?
