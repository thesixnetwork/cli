<!--
Please adapt sections as needed while keeping core descriptions clear and detailed. These sections are guidance, but accurate information will help ensure effective handling of the issue or request.
-->

### Context:

<!--
Describe the context for the feature request. What problem are you trying to solve, or what opportunity are you aiming to capture?

Consider:
- Is this request about making it easier for developers to use the CLI?
- Is it related to improving the user experience for bootstrapping Cosmos SDK chains?
- Is this intended to solve an ongoing issue or pain point encountered during the development process?
- Is this feature request in response to community feedback or specific needs identified during testing?

If you're unsure whether this should be a feature request, consider starting a new Discussion topic instead. If this is more about generating ideas, brainstorming, or honing in on a solution, starting a discussion might be more appropriate.
Refer to the guidelines in our [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Proposed Solution:

<!--
Provide a clear and concise description of the solution or feature you would like to see implemented.

Consider:
- How will this solution be integrated into the existing Ignite CLI workflow?
- Will this require changes to the configuration files (e.g., `config.yml`, `app.toml`)?
- Are there any specific commands or flags that this feature would add or modify?
- How will this feature impact the developer experience and the chain bootstrapping process?
-->

#### Alternatives Considered:

<!--
List any alternative solutions or approaches you've considered and why they may not be suitable.

Consider:
- Could this feature be an Ignite App instead of being part of the core CLI tool?
- Would this require significant maintenance effort or ongoing support?
- Is there existing functionality in the CLI or Cosmos SDK that could be extended or refactored instead of introducing new code?
- Have you explored alternative patterns, third-party tools, or existing Cosmos modules that could address the need?
- Would this feature introduce technical debt, and if so, what would be the trade-offs?
-->

### Expected Outcome:

<!--
Explain what success would look like. What behavior or result would indicate that this feature is working as expected?

Consider:
- What is the tangible impact of this feature? (e.g., faster setup times, easier customization, reduced developer friction)
- What are the measurable improvements? (e.g., improved performance, enhanced flexibility)
- What areas of the Ignite CLI or connected Cosmos SDK modules will this feature touch or improve?
-->

### Notes:

<!--
Include any other relevant information or context that could help in understanding the feature request, such as related issues, mockups, or potential use cases.

Consider:
- Are there related issues or bugs that this feature would resolve?
- Can you provide any screenshots, diagrams, or code snippets to illustrate your request?
- Is there a timeline or specific version where this feature should be prioritized?
