# Upgrading a blockchain to use Ignite CLI v0.22.2

Ignite CLI v0.22.2 changed the GitHub username from "ignite-hq" to "ignite", which means the imports must be fixed to reflect this change.

1. In your `go.mod` file find the require line for Ignite CLI that starts with `github.com/ignite-hq/cli` and is followed by a version.
   It looks something like `github.com/ignite-hq/cli v0.22.0`, and replace it by `github.com/ignite/cli v0.22.2`.

2. Make a bulk find and replace in the import statements for `github.com/ignite-hq/cli` to be replaced by `github.com/ignite/cli`.

3. Finally run `go mod tidy` and ensure there's no mention if `ignite-hq/cli` in your `go.mod` file.
